## 📖 Introduction

Migrating repositories from Bitbucket Server to GitHub is a multi-stage process that includes readiness validation, parallel repository migration, and post-migration verification. When applied across hundreds or thousands of repositories, this process becomes difficult to coordinate, error-prone, and hard to scale using ad-hoc commands.

This toolkit addresses those challenges through a staged, CSV-driven execution model. Each stage runs independently, produces machine-readable output, and can be executed from the command line or embedded inside a CI/CD pipeline. Failures in individual repositories are isolated - they do not block the remaining batch.

## ⚠️ Limitations

- **Repository Migration Size Limits**
The [GitHub Enterprise Importer](https://github.com/github/gh-gei) has the following size limits:

| Item | Maximum Size |
|------|--------------|
| Repository archive | ~40 GiB |
| Single file (during migration) | 400 MiB |
| Single file (after migration) | 100 MiB (larger files must use Git LFS) |
| Single commit | 2 GiB |

- **What Gets Migrated:**
  - Git repository content (all files)
  - Complete commit history
  - All branches and tags
  - Commit metadata (authors, dates, messages, SHAs)

- **Maximum Concurrency:**
  - The default concurrency is **3**. Increase with `--max-concurrent` up to 5.
  - The actual repository migration runs on **GitHub's backend services**, not on the local machine. The script only polls migration status at regular intervals.

 - **Github Hosted runners timeout:**
   - It is recommended to run GitHub Actions on self-hosted runners, where the job timeout can be configured to 0, allowing long-running migrations to complete without interruption. By contrast, GitHub-hosted runners are limited to a maximum job runtime of 360 minutes.

- **Track Long-Running Migrations:**
  - If a migration is taking longer than expected, monitor progress directly using the GitHub CLI: [GitHub Migration Monitor](https://github.com/mona-actions/gh-migration-monitor)
    ```bash
    gh extension install mona-actions/gh-migration-monitor
    gh migration monitor
    ```

## ⚙️ Prerequisites

- organization owner role for the destination organization in GitHub, or an organization owner must grant the migrator role.
- You must also have required permissions and access to your Bitbucket Server instance:
  -  Admin or super admin permissions.
  -  If your Bitbucket Server instance runs Linux, SFTP access to the instance, using a supported SSH private key.
  -  If your Bitbucket Server instance runs Windows, file sharing (SMB) access to the instance.
-  **GitHub Data Residency**, set `TARGET_API_URL` to the regional GitHub API endpoint (for example, https://api.tenant.ghe.com). 
- **GitHub PAT** (`GH_PAT`) with scopes `admin:org`, and `workflow`
- **Bitbucket Server:**
  - **Bitbucket Server URL:** `BBS_BASE_URL` — e.g., http://bitbucket.example.com:7990
  - **Basic auth:**
    - `BBS_AUTH_TYPE` : `Basic`
    - `BBS_USERNAME`
    - `BBS_PASSWORD`
  - **SSH:**
    - `SSH_USER` - SSH username for the Bitbucket Server host.
    - `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY` — an unencrypted (passphrase-free) private key.
- The `repos.csv` file must exist with the required columns: `project-key`, `project-name`, `repo`, `github_org`, `github_repo`, `gh_repo_visibility`.
- **Optional Storage backend:**
  - **AWS S3:** `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_BUCKET_NAME`, `AWS_REGION`
  - **Azure Blob:** `AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING`
  - **Github-owned:** 	*(nothing needed — automatic fallback)*

## 🔧 Initial Setup

The workflow file is already present at `bbs2gh-migration.yml`. You only need to configure the repository with the right secrets, variables, and environment on GitHub.

- **Add Repository Secrets:** Go to your GitHub repo → `Settings` → `Security` → `Secrets and variables` → `Actions` → `Secrets` → `New repository secret`, and add the following:
  - `GH_PAT`: GitHub PAT with `repo`, `admin:org`, and `workflow` scopes.
  - `BBS_PAT`: Required for Pre and Post Migration validation stages.
  - `BBS_PASSWORD`: Bitbucket password (only if using Basic auth)
  - `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY`: Contents of a passphrase-free private key (e.g. `~/.ssh/id_rsa`)
  - **Storage backend secrets** (add only one set, or none for GitHub-owned storage):
    - `AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING`: Azure Blob Storage
    - `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_BUCKET_NAME`, `AWS_REGION`: AWS S3
  - **Add Repository Variables:** Go to `Settings` → `Security` → `Secrets and variables` → `Actions` → `Variables` → `New Repository variable`, and add:
    - `BBS_AUTH_TYPE`: `Basic` (only if using Basic auth; omit when using `BBS_PAT`)
    - `BBS_USERNAME`: Bitbucket username (only if using Basic auth)
    - `SSH_USER`: SSH username for the Bitbucket Server host
    - `BBS_BASE_URL`: Bitbucket Server URL e.g. http://bitbucket.example.com:7990
    - `TARGET_API_URL`: Only for GitHub Data Residency e.g. https://api.tenant.ghe.com
    - `COMMIT_CHECK` *(optional)*: `false` to skip per-branch commit/SHA checks (default `true`)
    - `FAIL_ON_VALIDATION_FAILURES` *(optional)*: `true` to fail the Validation job on any discrepancy (default `false`)
  - **Create the migration-approval Environment:** The migration job is gated by a required reviewer. Go to `Settings` → `Environments` → `New environment`, name it exactly: `migration-approval`
  - **Then add one or more Required reviewers** - the migration job will pause and wait for approval before running.
  -  **Prepare `repos.csv`:** Edit repos.csv in the repository root with the repos you want to migrate
   
  
      | Column | Description |
      |--------|-------------|
      | `project-key` | Bitbucket project key (e.g., `MYPROJ`) |
      | `project-name` | Bitbucket project display name |
      | `repo` | Bitbucket repository slug |
      | `github_org` | Target GitHub organization |
      | `github_repo` | Target GitHub repository name |
      | `gh_repo_visibility` | `private`, `internal`, or `public` |

## 🚀 Quick Start

**Before you begin**, ensure you've completed the [Initial Setup](#-initial-setup):
- ✅ Repository secrets and variables configured
- ✅ migration-approval environment created with reviewers
- ✅ repos.csv updated and pushed to the default branch

1. **Trigger the workflow:** Go to `Actions` → `bbs2gh-migration` → Run workflow and set your inputs, then click `Run workflow`.
2. **Review Stage 0 - Pre-checks:** The Pre-check job runs automatically.
      - Go to the job's Summary tab and review the pre-check table
      - Check the uploaded artifact `bbs-prechecks-<run-id>` → `bbs_pr_validation_output-<timestamp>.csv`
      - Ensure no repos show open PR warnings. If they do, merge/close those PRs in Bitbucket before proceeding.
3. **Approve Stage 1 - Migration:** The Migration job pauses waiting for approval. Go to the workflow run and click `Review deployments` → `Approve to release it`.
      - Monitor the live status in the job logs (QUEUED / IN PROGRESS / MIGRATED / FAILED).
      - Once complete, download artifact migration-output-csv-<run-id> → repo_migration_output-<timestamp>.csv
      - Confirm all repos show MIGRATED.
4. **Review Stage 2 — Validation:**  The Validation job runs automatically after migration. Download artifact `validation-output-<run-id>` and check `validation-summary.md`:
      - ✅ All entries show Matching for branches, commit counts, and latest SHAs.
      - **Branch count and the "missing branches" comparison always cover every branch.** The per-branch commit/SHA deep-check is bounded for large repos: it checks the **default branch only** when a repo has ≤10 branches, or the **default branch plus up to 10 branches** when it has more than 10.

5. **Mannequins generation and reclaim:**  After you run a migration, all user activity in the migrated repository (except Git commits) is attributed to placeholder identities called mannequins.
    -  To generate a CSV file with a list of mannequins for an organization, Optionally, to include mannequins that have already been reclaimed, add the --include-reclaimed flag.: 
    `gh bbs2gh generate-mannequin-csv --github-org TARGET_ORG --output mannequins-bbs.csv`
    -  To reclaim generaate mannequins: 
    `gh bbs2gh reclaim-mannequin --github-org TARGET_ORG --csv mannequins-bbs.csv`

---

 
**Next Steps:**
- **More repositories?** Update `repos.csv` and rerun the workflow
- **Partial failures?** Fix the root cause, remove successfully migrated repos from `repos.csv`, and rerun workflow for remaining repos
